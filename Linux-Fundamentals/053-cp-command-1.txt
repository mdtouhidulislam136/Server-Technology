#
# Explain the following command line options for cp(1) command: -v, -u, -p ,-r
#
  
The cp command is a command-line utility for copying files and directories.
It supports moving one or more files or folders with options for taking backups and preserving attributes.
When we use cp -r this will recursively copy a folder and create a copy.
To show files that are being copied pass the -v option to the cp.
This prints the files and folders that are being copied to standard output.
If we want to copy the file only if it is newer than the destination, invoke the command with the -u option.
When copying a file, the new file is owned by the user running the command. Use the -p option to preserve the file mode
 
# End of file
